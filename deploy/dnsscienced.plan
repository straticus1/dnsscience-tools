Lets write low level analysis suite that consists of:

dnsscienced -> connects to dnsscience
dnsscience_collectd -> collects DNS query data 
dnsscience_checkd -> Checks known records and results
dnscience_check_unbound_cache -> Check unbound cache

All of these should work together with our current monitoring tooling.
